Project for Hack The North

Designed the UX for the registration and login pages (after speedrunning XML in a day), binge-read 
android studio and firebase docs and managed to figure out functional user authentication, intents that
transferred user information across several activities, and uploading and updating user information using
the firebare realtime database. T'was a grind.
